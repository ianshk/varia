## Create a headless design system using React Aria, Tailwind CSS, and Class Variance Authority for variants.

# Problem

Large and opinionated component libraries, such as Material UI, can be difficult to customize to match your designs and design systems.

# Solution

Create a headless UI component library that uses React Aria Hooks, Tailwind CSS, and Class Variance Authority to make adding class variants simple.

# Note

This is a proof of concept. I have added a button as an example, and I believe it is a good starting point for further development.
